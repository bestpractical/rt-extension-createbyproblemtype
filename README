RT-Extension-CreateByProblemType version 0.0.1


This extension modifies the "Create a ticket in..." drop-down on RT's
main page; instead of presenting a list of queue names, it instead
presents a list of problem types, and dispatches to the appropriate
queue.

It does this by inspecting the "Problem Type" custom field on each
queue, which should be of type "Select one value."  For each queue,
all possible values for this custom field will be added to the
drop-down, categorized under the queue name.  If a queue has no
"Problem Type" custom field, or the custom field has no possible
values, the queue name will appear instead.

This is a user-configurable option; advanced users may prefer to
revert to the simple queue name drop-down.  This preference appears
under the "General" header in user preferences, as "Create tickets by
selecting a problem type, not a queue."


How to install:

1. perl Makefile.PL
2. make
3. make install ( you may need root permission )

You will need to add the following lines to your RT_SiteConfig.pm:
    Set( @Plugins,qw(RT::Extension::CreateByProblemType) );
    Set( $CreateByProblemType, 1);
