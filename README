NAME
    RT-Extension-CreateByProblemType - Choose from Problem Types rather than
    Queues for new tickets

SYNOPSIS
    This extension modifies the "Create a ticket in..." drop-down on RT's
    main page; instead of presenting a list of queue names, it instead
    presents a list of problem types, and dispatches to the appropriate
    queue.

    It does this by inspecting the "Problem Type" custom field on each
    queue, which should be of type "Select one value." For each queue, all
    possible values for this custom field will be added to the drop-down,
    categorized under the queue name. If a queue has no "Problem Type"
    custom field, or the custom field has no possible values, the queue name
    will appear instead.

    This is a user-configurable option; advanced users may prefer to revert
    to the simple queue name drop-down. This preference appears under the
    "General" header in user preferences, as "Create tickets by selecting a
    problem type, not a queue."
